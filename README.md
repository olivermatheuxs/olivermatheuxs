## Hi there, I'm Oliver! 👋



### About me
- I am majoring in computer engineering, and I already have a degree in mechatronics technician.
- I have been working as a fullstack developer.
- I was an intern at Siemens LDA-BR in a project to develop mobile and web applications.


---

### What am I up to?
I prefer to work on projects that challenge me at every moment. Working in the same way, just repeating code is not really my thing, and this will probably soon be automated by an A.I.
